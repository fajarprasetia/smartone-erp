## Testing Procedure

To test the webhook implementation:

1. Start the development server with `pnpm dev`
2. Use a tool like curl to send a verification request:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/webhook/whatsapp?hub.mode=subscribe&hub.verify_token=smartone-erp-whatsapp-token&hub.challenge=CHALLENGE"
   ```
3. Verify that the response is the echo of the challenge parameter

For testing incoming messages in development, you can use a tool like ngrok to expose your local server to the internet, then configure the webhook URL in WhatsApp Business API to point to your ngrok URL.
